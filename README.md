# Programming-Assignment-1
This repository contains solutions for Programming Assignment #1, which involves implementing fundamental Python functions to address three distinct problems:

	1.	Alphabetical Sorting of Characters
A function that accepts a user-provided word and rearranges its characters in alphabetical order.

Task: Implement a function that accepts a string input, converts its characters into a sorted list, and returns a new string composed of the alphabetically ordered characters.

Core Operations:

· Convert the input string into a sequence of characters (e.g., a list).
· Apply a sorting algorithm or built-in function to order the characters.
· Combine the sorted sequence back into a single string for output.

	2.	Word-to-Emoticon Conversion
A function that processes a user-input sentence and replaces specific keywords with their corresponding emoticons.

Task: Implement a function that processes an input string, identifies specific predefined keywords, and substitutes each keyword with a corresponding emoticon character.

Core Operations:

· Define a mapping of target words to their emoticon replacements (e.g., using a dictionary).
· Iterate through each word in the input string.
· For each word, check if it exists in the mapping and perform the substitution.
· Return the modified string.

	3.	List Unpacking
A function that unpacks the list writeyourcodehere into three variables:
	•	first → stores the first element
	•	middle → stores all elements except the first and last
	•	last → stores the last element
The program then prints all three variables.

Task: Unpack a given list into three distinct variables using indexing and slicing operations to isolate the first element, the middle elements, and the last element.

Core Operations:

· Access the first element by index 0.
· Access the last element by index -1.
· Extract the middle elements by slicing from index 1 to index -1.
· Assign these values to separate variables.
